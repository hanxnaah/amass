<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>People all over the world are working in various capacities to bring about greater 
social good. Whether it is Habitat for Humanityâ€™s organizational effort to build 
homes for the poor or a startup trying to tackle the issue of global e-waste , these 
compelling stories all need to be told. With a single powerful video, individuals 
and social impact organizations can effectively broadcast their missions, scale and 
garner support for their work, and raise money. However, professional videography 
is expensive and no credible platform currently exists to find freelance videography
work. Amass Media aims to empower organizations and individuals to tell their 
social impact stories by creating a credible platform that connects individuals and 
social impact organizations with early career filmmakers looking to build their 
portfolios and make a difference. Linking these two groups, Amass Media makes 
video storytelling accessible to all and gives the world an opportunity to see
and support social impact in action. If you're interested, sign up and we'll let you 
know when it's ready to go.</p>
