    mission_heading:
      Amass Media aims to provide every organization, no matter its size,
      with access to video storytelling.
    mission_text:
      Today, video production is largely inaccessible to many because
      videographers are mostly found through word of mouth and professional
      production companies are often too expensive for smaller organizations.
      Furthermore, video buyersâ€™ limited knowledge of the video production
      process makes it difficult to successfully execute projects.
    vision:
      We believe that everyone should be able to use video to
      tell their story
