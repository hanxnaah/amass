  %h1 MISSION

  %p
    Amass Media aims to provide every organization, no matter their size, with
    access to video storytelling to raise critical funding, drive web traffic,
    spread awareness, and much more.

  %p
    Today, video production is largely inaccessible to many because
    videographers are often found through word of mouth and professional
    production companies are often too expensive for smaller organizations.
    Furthermore, video buyersâ€™ limited knowledge of the video production
    process makes it difficult to successfully execute projects.

    VISION

  %p
    A world where everyone, especially social changemakers working in the most
    remote areas of the world, regardless of their ability to pay, can find a
    videographer to tell their stories to reach their mission critical next
    step.

  %p
    We are a for-profit social enterprise that serves both for-profit companies
    and nonprofits to fulfill our mission.
