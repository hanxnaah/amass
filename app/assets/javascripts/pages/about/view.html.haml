  %h1 Our Mission
  %p
    %em Everyone, especially social changemakers should have access to video storytelling.
  %p
    Today, video production is largely inaccessible to many because videographers are often found through word of mouth. Beyond the lack of credible channels to connect, video buyersâ€™ limited knowledge of the video production process often leads to inability to find the right videographer and execute projects successfully. 

  %p
    Amass Media connects video buyers with videographers based on experience, geographic, and price-based matching. We also provide educational and project management tools to ensure successful executions of all of our matched projects
  
  %h1 Our Vision
  %p
    %em A world where all social changemakers, even those working in most remote areas of the world, can find a videographer to tell their stories in compelling video forms

  %p
    We are a for-profit social enterprise and use a tier-based and cross-subsidy pricing model to fulfill our mission.
